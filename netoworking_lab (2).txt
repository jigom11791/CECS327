1. Get a list of ip addresses 
	(ipconfig?)
	- Which ip addresses are valid

<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
<!--

2. How do I figure out which ip addresses i can connect to?
	- Which ip addresses are part of my p2p network?
	- port scan
		- probe the port
		- if the port is open, you can assume it is part of your network.
	- designate a port for out communication that are not commonly used.
* Can do something like ftp where there are 2 ports. one for communication and one for file transfer
